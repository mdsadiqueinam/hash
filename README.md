## Introduction
This package is a CommonJS version of the `@adonisjs/hash` package, originally written in pure ESM. It is a driver-based hashing library that includes `argon2`, `bcrypt`, and `scrypt` drivers. The generated hash from all the drivers are formatted using the [PHC string format](https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-string-format/blob/master/phc-sf-spec.md). This version has been converted to CommonJS to be compatible with projects using that module system.

## Original Documentation
The original documentation for `@adonisjs/hash` is available on the [AdonisJS website](https://docs.adonisjs.com/guides/hashing). Please note that this version of the package has been modified for CommonJS compatibility.
